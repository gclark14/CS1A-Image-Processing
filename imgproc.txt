* I will not be applying .ppm in my script when i save images, it will work no differently if i specify the output file to be a .ppm file.
So this was a fun project which was thoroughly difficult the whole time. The whole project really didn't come together until i figured sharpen image out. Once i knew how to do that, the others made a lot more sense in retrospect, and i very quickly got zoom working afterwords. It all clicks in one moment and things fall in place. I learned how to improve the flow of my code by having a certain style as far as where and how i group loops to make them easier to read. Especially in zoom, that was my favorite filter. Take care professor!
